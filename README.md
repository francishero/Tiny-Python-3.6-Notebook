CESS data structures and algorithms training 2017
==================================================


This is a basic Introduction to the python language.
I will use this as a guide for the CESS data structures and algorithms.
This is a guide to learn python quickly and move on to data structures and algorithms.
Follow this document as i will explain some concepts here that i wont be able to explain during the training.
